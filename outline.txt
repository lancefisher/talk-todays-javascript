Outline
========

Modern JavaScript is fast, powerful and runs anywhere. Despite its quirks, JavaScript is immensely popular and widely used.

However, knowing where to start with a new project is difficult given the wide variety of choice and rapid change in the field. We'll cover some history, the current lay of the land, and create a small app using some of the latest options that work well together.

Learn when to use npm vs bower (and why to use a package management system), how to test your code easily in multiple browsers using Jasmine and Karma. Discover which lines of code are tested using Instanbul for coverage. Use Browserify to bundle your modular code. Create understandable UI components with React.
